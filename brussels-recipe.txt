Carmelized Ginger Lime Brussels Sprouts

ngredients:

- Fresh organic brussels sprouts
- ginger root
- 1 medium lime (or more, for stronger lime flavor)
- grade B pure maple syrup (the dark kind)
- raw pepitas (pumpkin seeds) 
- OPTIONAL: bacon (pasture-raised, all natural)
- cooking fat (I recommend bacon grease, otherwise coconut oil, palm oil, ghee, or grass-fed butter)
- Himalayan salt (or pure, natural sea salt) 

Preparations:

(1) Rinse and cut the brussels sprouts in half. Cut away any dark spots or other bad parts. If your sprouts have long stalks, cut these away as well. 

(2) Grate or thinly slice ginger root, using more or less depending on how strong you like your ginger flavor. I like to slice about 2 Tablespoons of ginger root for one pound of Brussels Sprouts, which proves a stronger ginger flavor. 

(3) Roll your uncut lime on the counter with moderate pressure to loosen up the insides. Slice open your lime, remove any obvious seeds, and set it aside within arm's reach of your stove.

Cooking: 

(1) If you're using bacon, cut the bacon up into 1/2 inch pieces and pan-fry, stirring occasionally, until crispy. Remove bacon from the pan, allowing as much fat as possible to drip back into the pan. Set bacon aside and remove any remaining solids from the bacon fat in the pan. If necessary, adjust to medium heat. Skip to step #3.

(2) If you're not using bacon, start by heating a large, heavy skillet to medium heat. When your skillet is hot, add your cooking fat. 

(3) Add Brussels Sprouts to the skillet, salt lightly, and saute. After the sprouts begin to get brown and the edges start crisping, add the ginger. Stir frequently. As the ginger cooks, it will become slightly more translucent and soften up. When this happens, and your sprouts just start to look like they're cooking a bit dry, it's time to add the lime juice. 

(4) Reduce heat to medium-low. Squeeze the lime juice directly onto your sprouts. (Resist the urge to add slices, chunks, or any other solid form of lime to the skillet. This will result in a bitter taste in the dish. Some pulp is fine.)  Stir thoroughly, allowing to the leafy edges of the sprouts to start to caramelize.

(5) Add enough water (maybe 1/4 cup?) to cover the bottom of the skillet. Simmer until the water has all cooked off, stirring occasionally. Check the tenderness of the sprouts. If necessary, add a bit more water and simmer longer. I like my sprouts tender and a bit crisp. Add more salt or lime to taste. 

(6) Coat the pepitas with a bit of cooking fat and add to the skillet. Saute, stirring frequently, until they begin to brown and the leaves of the sprouts caramelize further. If you're using bacon, add the bacon pieces to the skillet shortly after adding the pepitas (you want to warm the bacon but not really cook it any further). 

(7) Add a small splash of maple syrup (dilute with a bit of water if needed to coat sprouts) and toss with sprouts. 

(8) Remove from heat and serve immediately.
